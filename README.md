# Investigate-a-Relational-Database_Sakila-DVD-Rental-database

## Overview
In this project, I used SQL to explore a database related to movie rentals. I wrote SQL code to run SQL queries and answer interesting questions about the database. I ran the SQL queries and built visualizations to showcase the output of the queries.

## Introduction
In this project, I querried the Sakila DVD Rental database. The Sakila Database holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs. I querried the database to gain an understanding of the customer base, such as what the patterns in movie watching are across different customer groups, how they compare on payment earnings, and how the stores compare in their performance.
